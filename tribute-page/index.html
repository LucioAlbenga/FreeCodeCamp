		        The Olivetti Programma 101, also known as Perottina or P101, is the first 
            commercial programmable "desktop computer".Produced by Italian manufacturer 
            Olivetti, based in Ivrea, Piedmont, and invented by the Italian engineer 
            Pier Giorgio Perotto, the P101 had the main features of large computers of 
            that period. It is usually called a printing programmable calculator or desktop 
            calculator because its arithmetic instructions correspond to calculator operations.

		      <cite>“By Apollo 11 we had a desktop computer, sort of, kind of, called 
                an Olivetti Programma 101. It was kind of a supercalculator. (…) 
                It would add, subtract, multiply, and divide, but it would remember 
		            a sequence of these things, and it would record that sequence on a 
                magnetic card (…). So you could write a sequence, a programming sequence, 
                and load it in there”  David W. Whittle, Johnson Space Center, NASA</cite>
